# Line Girl Effect

A Python implementation of the Line Girl effect (a variant of the Joy Division effect?). Inspired by this [Tweet](https://x.com/Moodsby_v/status/2000586572912042309) and this [Post](https://www.tumblr.com/low-sugar-eye-candy/169354251468/line-girl).

*Coded by Gemini 3 Pro and tweaked by me.*
